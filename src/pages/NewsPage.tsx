        <h4 className="my-4">New Data</h4>

        <h5 className="mt-4">Gene Signature Scores</h5>

        <p>
          <i>Gene Signature Scores</i> are now available for cell lines and tissue samples (including GTEx, TCGA, and PDX models). These can be added using the <i>Add Column</i> dialog:

        <img className=" img-fluid border border-ordino-gray-5" src={gene_signature} alt="Gene Signature Score" />

        <p className="card-text mt-2">Currently, the following gene signature scores are available:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            NIBR_IFN (Novartis 38 Gene Interferon activity signature)
              </li>

          This update contains more <b>data</b>, many <b>new features</b>, various <b>improvements</b>, and a large number of <b>bug fixes</b>. The most important changes are:
      </p>

        <h4 className="my-4">New data</h4>

        <h5 className="mt-4">Database</h5>
        <p>
          All data has be been updated from hg19 to hg38!
            </p>

        <h5 className="mt-4">HLA-A type, Mutational Burden and MSI Status</h5>
        <p>
          Now, HLA-A type, Mutational Burden and MSI Status data is available for many cell line and tissue samples.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <i> How to access</i>: Open a list of cell lines 	&#8594; click on “+” to open the “add column” dialog 	&#8594; select "Annotation Columns" 	&#8594; select the data of interest.
        </p>

        <h4 className="my-4">Completely new features</h4>
        <h5 className="mt-4">Basic statistical analyses</h5>
        <img className="img-fluid mb-2" src={tourdino} alt="Tourdino" />
        <p>
          It is now possible to do basic statistical analyses, like calculating the correlation of two columns, directly in Ordino.
      </p>
        <p>
          <i>How to access</i>: Click on the calculator icon on the right. This opens a new side-panel (highlighted in red in the screenshot below).<br /> There you can select which columns to compare and then get detailed information about the result.
      </p>

        <h4 className="my-4">Improved features</h4>

        <h5 className="mt-4">Improved column operations (filtering, sorting, etc)</h5>
        <p>
          <i>How to access</i>: click on any of the icons in the column headers.
            </p>
        <p>
          The column dialogs were harmonized.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is now a live preview. For instance, if you modify the filter setting of a column, you can see in the background how this will affect your list of genes, cell lines, and tissue samples.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is now possible to reset all filters at once in the right side-panel. <i>Access side-panel by clicking on the left-facing arrow in the menu on the right</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The grouping of text columns (like mutations) is now working much better (e.g., allowing you to split your cell lines by specific mutations). <i>How to access: click the “…” in the column header and then select “Group By”</i>.
      </p>

        <h5 className="mt-4">Interactive help tours</h5>
        <p>
          And to make it easier for new users to get to know Ordino, we also added two additional interactive help tours that guide you through the application.
            </p>
        <p>
          <i>These can be accessed by clicking on the “?” in the upper right corner of Ordino</i>.
      </p>

        <h5 className="mt-4">Briefly noted</h5>

        <p>
          Improved look and feel of the list of cell lines, genes, and tissue samples.
         </p>
        <p>
          Collapsing and expanding of sample / gene groups is now recorded in the session history.
         </p>
        <p>
          The columns "AA mutated" and "DNA mutated" have been harmonized. There is now no category "Unknown" anymore, but missing values are handled the same way as in all other columns.
         </p>
        <p>
          File upload has been improved and now supports boolean (i.e., true/false) columns.
         </p>
